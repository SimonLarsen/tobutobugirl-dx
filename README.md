A dual GB/GBC remaster of Tobu Tobu Girl.

More info at: http://tangramgames.dk/tobutobugirldx.

This fork changes the code so that it can be built with just GBDK-2020, greatly simplifying the build process.

## Playing the game

In order to play the game you will need to either flash the game to a Game Boy flash cart or use a Game Boy emulator. The binaries are provided through [itch.io](https://tangramgames.itch.io/tobutobugirldx).

## Compilation
This fork eliminates the need for different versions of GBDK and SDCC, so only GBDK-2020 is required. pyimgtogb is also included in the repository.
